Utility commands to manipulate and analyze LCOV tracefiles blazingly fast.

[LCOV] is a graphical front-end for coverage testing tool [gcov].
It collects gcov data for multiple source files and stores them into the file called as "tracefile".

The purpose of this crate is to operate the LCOV tracefile faster than [the original LCOV Perl
implementation][LCOV GitHub].

## Install

```console
cargo install lcov-util
```

## Performance

### Merge LCOV tracefiles

Comparing the execution of merging LCOV tracefiles, between 3 programs:

* `lcov 1.16`: [Latest released version of `LCOV`][lcov-release]
* `lcov master`: [Latest development version of `LCOV`][lcov-dev]
* `lcov-merge`: `lcov-merge` executable from [`lcov-util` v0.2.0][lcov-util]

with 3 datasets (generated by [`mkinfo` tool from LCOV repository][mkinfo]):

* small: merging 5 small tracefiles (2 tests, 5 source files)
* medium: merging 5 medium tracefiles (3 tests, 50 source files)
* large: merging 5 large tracefiles (2 tests, 500 source files)

|                  | small | medium |  large  |
| ---------------- | ----- | ------ | ------- |
| `lcov 1.16`      | 0.22s | 2.41s  | 21.69s  |
| `lcov master`    | 0.23s | 2.30s  | 21.34s  |
| **`lcov-merge`** | 0.01s | 0.21s  |  2.73s  |

In this benchmark, `lcov-merge` is 10-20x faster than `lcov 1.16` / `lcov-master`.

* Environment:
  * Arch Linux (5.10.16.3-microsoft-standard-WSL2)
  * AMD Ryzen 9 5950X

## Minimum supported Rust version (MSRV)

The minimum supported Rust version is **Rust 1.56.1**.
At least the last 3 versions of stable Rust are supported at any given time.

While a crate is pre-release status (0.x.x) it may have its MSRV bumped in a patch release.
Once a crate has reached 1.x, any MSRV bump will be accompanied with a new minor version.
